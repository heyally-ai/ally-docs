## What makes Ally different?

**AI that makes sense, actually helps, and works well:** Ally doesn't utilize AI just to check a box, it's implemented for very specific use cases, a lot of it is completely invisible, and it stays out of your way when not needed. Each application of AI is meticulously designed and tested to ensure predictable, accurate results. 

**Ally remembers and adapts:** Ally converts your life's data into markdown documents which become vectorized embeddings which create a sophisticated, constantly evolving, knowledge graph that allows Ally to understand the relationships between information, tasks, people, so it can do a better job of keeping you organized, assisting with your obligations, creating deliverables, and more.

**Complexity is hidden:** Out of the box, Ally has recommended settings that are ideal for the majority of users. But, if you like to tinker, you can adjust the UI, AI models, and keyboard shortcuts, and more in Settings.

**Multi-modal capture:** Voice, text, screen, and files — capture anything and everything — however it comes to you.

**Intelligent organization:** AI automatically extracts tasks and insights, builds connections, and helps you organize & find what you need, exactly when you need it. Ally isn't just doing semantic search on your past chats, it's building a sophisticated knowledge graph out of everything so it understands the relationships between your data and how things are interconnected.

**Quick capture focus:** Frictionless capture is a cornerstone of Ally. We''re focused on making it easy to bring your life into Ally with features like iPhone Action Button support, quick start recordings from the notch, our Safari web clipper, and more.

**Privacy-first:** All AI processing happens locally on your device. Your data never leaves your Mac or iPhone. You don't even create an account. It's not possible for us to access your data, show you ads, or leak your data, ever.

**Local-first:** Keep data and processing local whenever possible to avoid security and privacy concerns. 

**Data ownership:** No lock in, open formats, accessible data. 

**Consumer first pricing:** Pricing should be transparent, fair, and accessible to everyone.
