# Getting started with Ally

Get Ally installed in minutes.

<Callout type="info">
Ally requires macOS 14.6+ or iOS 17+ to run. Check your system version before installing.

Using the macOS and iOS apps together is recommended, but they can be used separately.
</Callout>

## Installation

### macOS

1. Download the Ally macOS app from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ally-ai-for-life/id6752736179)
2. Launch the Ally app from your Applications folder or by opening Spolight (`command + space`) and searching `Ally`

### iOS

1. Download Ally from the [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ally-ai-for-life/id6752736179)
2. Launch Ally

## Initial setup

### First Launch

When you first open Ally you'll be asked for recording permissions. Ally requests certain permissions to function:

- **Microphone** - For voice recording and transcription
- **Screen Recording** (macOS) - For capturing system audio (necessary for capturing meeting audio)
- **Notifications** - For recording transcription status and reminders

<Callout type="warning">
If you skip granting permissions during setup, you'll need to enable them manually in System Settings → Privacy & Security.
</Callout>

## Next Steps

<Callout type="tip">
Pro tip: Set up keyboard shortcuts first! Quick capture is the fastest way to use Ally.
