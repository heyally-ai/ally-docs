You may want to keep your Ally data private because it contains sensitive personal or professional information.  Enabling Face ID is a quick and easy way to protect your Ally vault data so that only you can access it. 

## To enable Face ID on your iPhone:

1. Find the Ally app icon on your iPhone home screen.

2. Long press the icon (press and hold) until the options menu appears.

3. Press "Require Face ID"

The next time you open the Ally app, your iPhone will require a Face ID scan before opening so your Ally data is protected.
