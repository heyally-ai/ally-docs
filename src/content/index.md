# What is Ally?

Ally is a privacy-first productivity app that makes it easy to capture your thoughts, todos, reminders, meetings, lectures, webpages, and any other info you want to save. It's a flexible personal & professional knowledge management system paired with intelligent AI that runs fully locally.  

It converts all of this data into markdown and then vectorized embeddings and creates a sophisticated, constantly evolving, knowledge graph that allows Ally to keep you organized, assist you with your obligations, create deliverables, and more.

Your data never leaves your computer. Your chats use an LLM running locally on your computer, audio is transcribed locally, agentic workflows run locally, vector embeddings are generated locally, and all your data is stored in a local database.

## Ally's core features:

## What makes Ally different?

**Privacy-first:** All AI processing happens locally on your device. Your data never leaves your Mac or iPhone. You don't even create an account. It's not possible for us to access your data, show you ads, or leak your data, ever.

**Quick capture focus:** Frictionless capture is a cornerstone of Ally. We''re focused on making it easy to bring your life into Ally with features like iPhone Action Button support, quick start recordings from the notch, our Safari web clipper, and more.

**AI that makes sense, actually helps, and works well:** Ally doesn't utilize AI just to check a box, it's implemented for very specific use cases, a lot of it is completely invisible, and it stays out of your way when not needed. Each application is meticulously designed and tested to ensure predictable, accurate results. 

**Complexity is hidden:** Out of the box, Ally has recommended settings that are ideal for the majority of users. But, if you like to tinker, you can adjust the UI, AI models, and keyboard shortcuts, and more in Settings.

**Multi-modal capture:** Voice, text, screen, and files — capture anything and everything — however it comes to you.

**Intelligent organization:** AI automatically extracts tasks and insights, builds connections, and helps you organize & find what you need, exactly when you need it. Ally isn't just doing semantic search on your past chats, it's building a sophisticated knowledge graph out of everything so it understands the relationships between your data and how things are interconnected.
