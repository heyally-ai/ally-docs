description: Add meeting transcripts to Obsidian automatically

You can automatically add meeting transcripts and voice notes to Obsidian via the export function.

For flexibility, Ally offers two export locations: Primary and Secondary. You could use either one for Obsidian sync, it's just a matter of preference, they operate identically. 

## To export recording transcripts to Obsidian:

1. Open Ally Settings (`Ally > Settings`)

2. Click on the `Recording tab`

3. Scroll down to the `Storage locations` section. 

4. Click the `Select` button for either the Primary location or additional location (it's up to you, they both work the same) and then select the Obsidian directory you want your transcripts added to. You may want to create a new `Meetings` directory. 

That's it! Now, when new transcripts are generated, they'll automatically be added to your Obsidian database for further processing.
