You may want to keep your Ally data private.  Enabling Face ID is a quick and easy way to protect your Ally vault so that only you can access it. 

## To enable Face ID on your iPhone:

1.) Find the Ally app icon on your iPhone home screen.
2.) Long press the icon (press and hold) until the options menu appears.
3.) Press "Require Face ID"

Now, your Ally value is protected by Face ID and will not open without biometric confirmation of your identity.
