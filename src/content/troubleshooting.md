## Audio Issues

### Microphone Not Working

**Symptoms:** Recording doesn't capture audio

**Solutions:**
1. Check microphone permissions in System Settings. Ensure you've granted both Screen Capture and Microphone permissions. 
2. You may need to restart the app after granting Screen Capture permissions to ensure they take effect. Restart Ally by quitting and reopening the app.
3. Try a different microphone input
4. Check if other apps can access microphone

### Poor Transcription Quality

**Symptoms:** Transcriptions are inaccurate

**Solutions:**
1. Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
2. Reduce background noise
3. Check microphone quality and positioning
4. Update to latest Ally version for model improvements

## Sync Issues

**Solutions:**
1. Verify iCloud is enabled in System Settings
2. Check iCloud storage availability
3. Force sync from Ally settings
4. Sign out and back into iCloud

## Performance

### App Running Slow

**Symptoms:** Ally is laggy or unresponsive

**Solutions:**
1. Check available disk space
