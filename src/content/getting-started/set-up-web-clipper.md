#### Save method 1: Clicking the Ally extension icon in the Safari top toolbar

1. Click the triangle "Ally icon" that appears next to the Safari address bar. 
2. A dropdown will appear that gives you the option to add any notes. This is a good idea if you often find yourself wondering why you saved something when you find it later.

These keyboard shortcuts are configurable. Customize them in the Ally web clipper browser extension settings.
